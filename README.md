This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: unexpected type errors that frequently occur when working with asynchronous operations and libraries expecting specific data types. The `UnexpectedTypeError.js` file showcases the bug, while `UnexpectedTypeErrorSolution.js` offers a solution.  The issue arises because the library attempts to utilize data before it has fully loaded or when the data's type doesn't match its expectations. The solution emphasizes effective type checking and proper handling of asynchronous data to prevent the error.
